      "7765 Now, the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change is the world body with most of the interest and does focus on this subject of global warming. And it is the body that most people look to on this subject. Now, for many years the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change used a chart that clearly shows the temperature from 1000 A.D. to about 1450 A.D., that the temperatures during that period were significantly warmer than the latter part of the 20th Century, or the late 1990s. Now, in 1998 and 1999, a\n",
      " paleoclimatologist, Dr. Michael Mann, with Raymond Bradley and Dr. Malcolm Hughes, introduced a new technique to develop more quantitative estimates of the nature of climate change since 1000 A.D. and concluded that the late 20th Century was the warmest in 1,000 years, that the warming during the late 1990s was the warmest in over 1,000 years. Now, as a result of that report, the IPCC incorporated the study with other data which eliminated the warming period for 1000 A.D. to 1450 A.D. and incorporated a new graph referred to as the \"hockey stick\" graph, which shows remarkable\n",
      " warming in the late 1990s. Now, when Chairman Barton and I wrote a letter asking that the Mann report be reviewed by some statisticians, there was a hue and cry around the country among many people in the news media that we were being totally political, that all we were trying to do was gut this issue that global warming is occurring. But I think quite sincerely that we have a responsibility when public policy decisions being made on reports like the Mann report and others have such a broad impact on so much of our society and certainly the Kyoto arguments were primarily based on this new chart, that the U.S. should be part of Kyoto. That was an important part of that. And so what we did was, we asked that Dr. Wegman and a team that he had review these data. Now, when we did that, Sherry Boehlert, who is a good Republican friend of ours and is Chairman of the Science Committee, was quite upset about it and he said I think you all are being political also, and he asked that we ask Dr. North, who is going to be a witness, and would like for him to be involved in this data analysis, and he is going to be a witness today also. But the real purpose of this is that this issue is so important that I think it is imperative that we hear from all sides and try to get some real\n",

      "7783 Now, I have not seen Dr. Wegman until I walked in this room. I have not talked to him on the phone or in person or any of his\n",
      " collaborators. I may have seen Dr. North at Texas A&M since I went to Texas A&M. I don't recall it but it is possible. He has got enough white in his hair that I could have been one of his students and I wouldn't remember it, so I can't stipulate that I have never met him but I can stipulate that I have never met Dr. Wegman. We asked to find some experts to try to replicate Dr. Mann's work. Now, to their credit, when Dr. Wegman agreed to do it, he asked for no compensation. I don't think we have even paid him for the fax paper that he has used. He picked some eminent statisticians in his field and they studied this thing. Had their report said Dr. Mann's data can be replicated, his conclusions are right on point, he is totally correct, we would have reported that, but that is not what they said. Now, I took statistics at Texas A&M and I also took them in graduate school. I made A's and B's, but I really didn't understand it but I kind of understand it. And according to Dr. Wegman, Dr. Mann made a\n",
      " fundamental error. He decentered the data. Now, to the average person, that doesn't mean squat. What does \"decentered the data\" mean? What it means apparently is, he moved it off center a little bit by enough that it really makes a difference and then using some\n",
      " statistical techniques that instead of looking at all the variables and in a complex system like climate you are going to have lots of variables, he chose one or two as the principal variables and used those to explain everything else, and Dr. Wegman and his colleagues who as far as I know have got no axe to grind, have said the Mann study is flat wrong. Now, it may be wrong just kind of unintentionally. Dr. Wegman doesn't say there is any intent to deceive but he says it is flat wrong. Now, if that is not the purpose of the Oversight Subcommittee of the Energy and Commerce Committee that has got jurisdiction over energy and environmental policy for the United States of America, then I don't know what this subcommittee should be doing. \n",

      "8819 Only through the media, and I had the impression that this was not very helpful, what has happened there, but I don't know the details, and this would be an example where I would ask some social scientists to really go after this, what really has happened here. I think it would be worth doing it. But when we speak about this storm business, I would like to tell a little story, namely in the early 1990s we had the press in northern Europe full of messages that we would have more storms, and these storms would be proof or would be a result of global warming going on. And you have to know that when people think about climate change, anthropogenic climate change in the past, it always is associated with more storms. So if you read about the cooling in the 1970s, what the response would be, it was cooler and more stormy, so it seems that it is part of our cultural heritage that whenever we think we change climate to the worse, then we have more storms. Later on it turned out that we actually have less storms now in northern Europe. And if we believe our climate change models, and I do believe them and I am sincerely convinced that we see global warming happening. If we believe these models then we should have an intensification of storms in our part of the world with stronger wind speeds of the order of 10 percent of the end of the century, that would be a signal which cannot be detected. While if you go into the details, then you find out that several aspects are rather similar to the ongoing hurricane debate, namely that good data exists only for a short time. Satellites are flying only since the 1970s or so, and observing this, and you have decades with strong activity and decades with less strong activity. It is the same with the storms in our part of the world. And so I would say in this case one should be very careful in making definite conclusions about that. And if we believe our models, and I am not sure if we should believe in this respect our models, then we also should have a signal which is much weaker now, hardly detectable at this time. So in this case with the hurricanes, I would advise to wait a little bit before definite conclusions are drawn. And this would be an example that somehow this preconception that storms are getting worse when climate is changing is somehow controlling what we think. \n",

      "12233 I am going to go at this in a different direction. I think that there is pretty much unanimity that there is climate change taking place, global warming taking place, and this committee is gathering information, scientific information within our jurisdiction. And I assume that information will be shared with other committees that will have the jurisdiction to regulate certain industries, such as the coal industry, the automobile industry, the hydrocarbon-fired energy sources within the United States. And so it is important that we try to get it right, because the unintended consequences of taking bad information and trying to make policy is going to have dramatic effects on the economy of this country and certainly for the rest of the world. And so when Mr. Rohrabacher, for instance, is asking the question how much of a percentage, for us laymen, is greenhouse gases relative to natural sources, that is an important question, because—and also, the question of what countries and what regions have an increase relative to natural sources for—we have a better understanding of how we go about that problem. But it has been said that the United States produces 25 percent—or uses 25 percent of the energy in the world, and it is about four percent of the world’s population. So you know, you could say that the United States, overwhelmingly, has the most responsibility to regu late its economy in order to meet its responsibilities, especially under the Kyoto accord, which I went to with Mr. Sensenbrenner a number of years ago. So we have got to get it right, because I would suspect the four of you all agree that with the summary of the report, 90 percent confidence that human activity is the cause of global warming. Would you say that all four of you agree to that basic concept, since you are here, obviously, testifying for the majority? And so if, in fact, that is correct, how do we go about tackling this problem? And I think that that is really what this Congress is going to be trying to answer, whether we go into mandatory caps, which was mentioned by the Speaker, or, as I believe, incentives in the economy to bring on new industries that I think will have the same result in the long-term and in the short-term of having—the result of having less greenhouse gases. In that, China—the issue of China has been brought up. I believe China, right now, is opening a new coal-powered plant once a week. And is that approximately correct? \n",
      "\n",
      "12254 My colleague, Mr. Rohrabacher, is somehow concerned, I believe, that because humans produce only about 10 percent of the greenhouse gases that what we do, maybe, doesn’t matter much. And I have a little illustration that may help us to understand that the total amount of gases up there may be somewhat irrelevant relative to what we can do to change that. If you have a seesaw with 100 pounds on each end and you put another 100 pounds on one end, that is really going down, isn’t it? If you put 1,000 pounds on each end as the seesaw and you put another 100 pounds on one end, it is still going down, isn’t it? So the total amount of greenhouse gases that are up there may be somewhat irrelevant as to our contribution. Obviously, where our Earth’s temperature is, it is a balance between the heat we gain from the sun and the heat we lose. And you know, a very small change can produce enormous effects. I was stunned the other day when I read, and I would ask you if this is true, that in the last ice age the world was five degrees centigrade, that is nine degrees Fahrenheit, cooler than it is today. That is correct? And for those that think, gee, a degree or two, my living room goes up and down three or four degrees. That doesn’t matter much. Three or four degrees in the world may not matter much. But nine degrees cooler Fahrenheit, and we were in an ice age. With ice sheets coming down to southeast Ohio, you can see the terminal there from those, someone was asking about where it is warmer and where it is cooler. There is an ironic thing that could happen as the result of global warming, that is that the British Isles and northern Europe could become very much colder because we have a big conveyor belt called the Gulf Stream, which carries heat from the tropics up there. And obviously, water is not piling up up there, so it has to come back. And it comes back, because it gets more dense and it drops down. And one of the things that is happening up there may prohibit this increase in density and that is the melting of ice up there, which produces fresh water, which is very much lighter than the salty water. And so if we have a little bit more global warming, we could shut down the Gulf Stream. And if you look at where England is on the globe, it is up about central Canada. I had to stop for refueling in the Emerald Isle. And that really is incredibly green and warm there in Ireland compared to what it would be if it weren’t for the Gulf Stream. So we can have enormous changes in climate in certain parts of the world from relatively small changes in temperature. \n",

      "26255 Not to my knowledge. Very loyal answer. There is no question obviously that the Earth is going through a warming trend right now. There is no question about that. One realizes that the Earth warming trends perhaps dozens of times, and the major question is is this warming trend caused by human activity. If it is not, should we not be looking at adapting rather than arrogantly thinking that mankind can reverse what has been a trend of nature over these many hundreds of thousands, if not millions of years of the life of the planet? Let me just say, and of course we are looking at the effects of this in terms of polar bears, et cetera. One of the reasons some of us like myself are skeptical of some of these things is just that I remember very much the predictions of dire and doom for the caribou. We ended up building a pipeline across Alaska, and I don't have to ask you, you all know, that the caribou population has drastically expanded since that pipeline, although people were testifying before Congress and just as adamant as yourselves that the caribou population was going to be decimated by the fact that there would be a pipeline across Alaska. And quite often we hear people with these dire predictions in order to whatever, accomplish perhaps other political ends. This might be more consistent with what Mr. Soros has in mind. Let me ask you this. We know the ice cores and these testings that give us an understanding of climate change in the planet, apparently Dr. Timothy Ball, who is a former climatology professor at the University of Winnipeg, stated that the theory, and I quote, in theory the claim that if CO2 goes up, temperature will go up is wrong. The ice core record for the last 420,000 years shows exactly the opposite, that indeed increases in the temperature bring about more CO2, rather than CO2 increases bringing about the increase in the temperature, which of course leads directly to whether or not human kind is actually causing this increase in temperature. Now, Dr. Juday was mentioning how the methane gas is bubbling up as the temperature increases. It seems to me your testimony backed up Dr. Ball's observation, because what you were saying is that as the temperature has gone up there is more methane being put into the atmosphere. It would be wrong to say that methane increasing in the atmosphere was causing the temperature to go up, is that not correct? \n",

      "29837 The subject of today's hearing is two-pronged. First, how does the adoption of cap-and-trade legislation to limit U.S. emissions of greenhouse gases affect the competitiveness of U.S. goods sold at international trade? Second, what are the best legislative alternatives or combination of tools for mitigating negative effects? We look forward to the views of the witnesses on these important matters. In the white paper on international competitiveness released in late January, three main concerns were raised. First, absent corresponding action by developing countries, the adoption of limits on greenhouse gas emissions by the U.S. and other developed countries will not achieve the goal of protecting the global environment. Second, if the U.S. were to cap its own emissions without corresponding actions by developing actions with whom we compete internationally, the relative cost to American products would increase and would cause U.S. jobs and industry to migrate to other nations that do not limit their emissions. Third, past debate on climate change suggests that the Congress would be unlikely to adopt legislation committing the United States to limiting its own greenhouse gas emissions in the absence of assurances that developing countries will take similar action. And I would note that the rejection of the Kyoto Treaty in the Senate and in popular acceptance tends to support that statement very strongly. Of course, crafting legislation to address these concerns presents Congress with a unique challenge since its actions cannot unilaterally bind other countries. Like the underlying U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change, the recent Bali roadmap for negotiating a post-Kyoto international agreement reflects differing roles and intentions between developed and developing nations in fulfilling the 1992 Rio Treaty's goals. With this in mind, the white paper outlines several options suggested in prior testimony before this Subcommittee, some of which have been incorporated into legislation under consideration in the Senate. The white paper also solicits comments on different approaches. I am interested to learn whether our witnesses believe a hybrid approach that combines both carrots and sticks with respect to developing countries could best achieve the goal of limiting carbon emissions without harming the U.S. economy. I would note that this is one of the most difficult issues the Congress faces in crafting climate change legislation and that we welcome not only the ideas that will be presented by today's witnesses but also the views of others who might wish to comment on the questions raised in the white paper. \n",

      "32593 Mr. Mullett, I just want to say a couple things at the start, and that is, I sat down with some of my truckers this last week and I am very concerned about them but also the people that work for them because they are losing their jobs and particularly in rural areas. It is really tough. I have got a number of counties and often you will see an independent operator, maybe it is just him or her and that truck is just parked along the side. I was one that supported an increase in CAFE, and that was a pretty tough vote coming from Michigan, but at the same time, I said I don't want it to be an unfunded mandate, that we need to help the industry. In fact, I hope that we might have a hearing later on this year, maybe this fall, when things perhaps shut down a little bit on the House floor in terms of how the industry is going to meet those targets as they struggle to do that. It is one of the ideas that Mr. Boucher has, Boucher and myself and Mr. Barton and Shimkus and others with the Carbon Capture, Storage Early Deployment Act. We are going to try to help the industry get there in terms of offering an actual fund where we can capture this carbon and really help and I want to see that happen with the auto industry. I have Eaton in my district, and they are doing a terrific job at develop some hybrid technology, and when I went out there last summer, we brought the secretary of EPA and the administrator, or the administrator rather of EPA, and literally we found that the technology that they have now can save the average UPS truck 1,000 gallons that they don't have to use just on the idling technology and other things and I would like to think that whether it be this committee or Ways and Means, we can help with legislation to promote that, to help the industry, and I would just urge you to talk to your colleagues at ATA to see what we can do. We think it is a bipartisan bill to try and push those incentives so you don't have those unfunded mandates as we struggle with these prices that clearly are not going to be going down. I just was struck by that in your testimony about all the truckers, literally 10,000 operations that are out of work just this year because of the increase. \n",

      "32612 Mr. Chairman, I will take the question on since we are the ones that have been pushing hard for it. We believe it really is a starting point, and we supported the international legislation that appeared in the Bingaman-Specter bill. We worked through the changes of that that then appeared in the Boxer-Lieberman-Warner bill. The attorneys we worked with are the top environmental attorneys and trade attorneys in the country, and they assured us that it is WTO compliant. Now, we absolutely know that no matter what we do, there is going to be a WTO test of it, but from our point of view, we think these steps we have been taking are WTO compliant. There are additional suggestions that have come in that were being proposed in the Senate. They weren't taken in the bill but I am certainly it is going to be discussed in the House, and we are willing to look at that. We are actually willing to look at that and other means. I know Mr. Inslee has talked about an input-output solution that I have not really had the chance to examine--we haven't had the chance to look at. We believe in redundancy but we strongly support international steps around that. We believe that it is compliant, and sort of the proof in the pudding is, what we have proposed, the EU has actually threatened to implement on two occasions in the last year. The discussion is very live in Europe about it. They have a cap-\n",
      "and-trade program and they have had it in place 3 years, and basically the first rule for the WTO is that you have to be doing it to yourself before you can apply it to somebody else, and the proposal we put together mirrors that. It says OK, we have a cap-and-trade, we are asking other developed countries and others to participate. It is not going to be exactly the same but they have to have something comparable to do that, and if not, if they choose not to, then there would be a cost to that, and so it is exactly as the EU has talked about, employing that in the European Union it would actually apply to us because we don't have a comparable system at this point. But I think that is something we have to do and we have to talk about these issues together. We can't ignore them. It is very, very important. \n",

      "65344 All right. Well, the chemist might get a little closer, but the real question here is, what kind of cost-benefit analysis of this entire process is being done relative to whatever environmental benefits are derived from doing this relative to this enormous cost that we are putting through this system? So my question to each of you is, are you familiar with another alternative that has been proposed by another, I think he is also an economist but I am not sure, a fellow some of you are probably familiar with named Bj<rn Lomborg, who has a written book called Cool It. He has written some other books in this area. Are any of you familiar with Mr. Lomborg's work? Basically he says global warming exists, global warming is at least in part and perhaps significantly caused by human activity but that cap-and-trade, the Kyoto protocols and even the kind of undertaking that Dr. Wara would propose. It is an enormous waste of resources that redirects huge sums of money, trillions of dollars over the course of this century for a very limited marginal benefit in terms of the climate change that will be affected. That it would make much more sense to devote multiple times the amount of money we put into research today into developing with government resources but still a fraction, \\1/20\\ of the cost of this legislation, developing more efficient alternative sources of energy that are carbon emission-free whether it is wind energy or solar or geothermal or hydrogen, or things we haven't even thought of. All of which are today far more expensive than our traditional sources of coal, oil, and natural gas. Even nuclear power, which somehow this legislation gives very short shrift to and it is totally carbon emission-free, and by far the most efficient way to generate energy that we have available to us right now today. This would be the better alternative to pursue and that we are also by this expensive cap-and-trade process foregoing the opportunity to spend those resources on cleaner water, fighting diseases, eliminating hunger around the world. Instead, we see from Dr. Glauber's testimony earlier, and from some of your testimony as well, confirming that this is going to add to the cost of food fairly significantly. One of you, I think it was Dr. Hayes, said that corn prices will be 28 percent greater than they otherwise would be than the baseline and soybeans 20 percent by 2023. Dr. Glauber said hog production will be 23 percent lower and beef slaughter ten percent lower, which would yield higher prices again in the 20 to 30 percent range for several of these commodities as well. Why are we doing that? \n",
