It has taken 20 years of technology development to devise a geared means todecouple the rotation of that fan so that gives you the ability to take the compressor and turbine, let them run at a high speed, high- speed turbine could be done, high-speed compressor could be done with a smaller number of parts; therefore they run more efficiently. They reduce the weight, the maintenance requirements. At the same time, the fan now geared to run at a slower speed operates much more efficiently than a normal configuration, runs slower, runs quieter.

13367,110hhrg35445,"Well, probably the easiest way to explain that is, I was over in Europe and I heard one of the other steel makers put a presentation on to us with respect to the impact of Kyoto and the E.U. trading program for them, and he said that first off, if I remember correctly, their energy costs have gone up 40 euros per megawatt and then had dropped down. That was roughly a double--or energy costs had gone up two times. His environmental costs which he was really the purchaser of the allowances and that type of transaction had gone up approximately another 10 to 13 euros per ton. So if you kind of throw that in there, you are talking potentially $30 to $40 a ton on steel or possibly more than that. That is just using the numbers that they showed us over there. In an industry that is sometimes razor-thin whether you are going to make any money or not, that would be tough for us. For other industries that are competing with other countries' products that are shipped into this country and have a much larger carbon footprint and they have to compete with that, and they have lower energy costs, we have the higher energy costs, we may have lower emissions with it but they have higher emissions with their product.

32195,110hhrg56980,"Well, I think currently world food demand has driven the price of fertilizer off the charts. Farmers are paying the highest prices they ever paid for fertilizer, and the difference is, our distribution system is much longer now. Farmers have traditionally been used to setting their planting date, going to their fertilizer dealer and saying I am planting tomorrow, get the fertilizer there. Today that is not true. The farmers have to start planning much longer now than they ever have, and because the logistics of bringing urea fertilizer from Qatar is 45 days on the seas, 20 days coming up the river. So it is a lot longer logistic system. And I think in this tight supply, every ton of fertilizer that is produced in the world today is being bid on by three or four countries, India, China, Brazil, and that fertilizer doesn't necessarily have to come to the United States, and that is the difference.",0,0,0

The AIA believes strongly that now is the time to react to address climate change by tackling energy use in buildings. Our Nation needs to begin making significant reductions in the amount of fossil fuel-generated energy our buildings consume. As your Committee has jurisdiction over the Public Building Service of the General Services Administration, this Committee is in a unique position to make policy decisions that could result in new and renovated Federal buildings using far less energy than current buildings.",0,0,0

It is not the kind of broadbased carbon market system that we are talking about. So I think that one can have a great deal of certitude. The CDM is bureaucratic. It has to be approved on a project-by-project basis by a bureaucracy. It hasn't approved one forest-based project at all. It is very flawed. It is really something we should be moving away from. So it is not a model at all for what I am talking about.",0,0,0

You need to have some provision, whether it is through the use of tariffs or something, that will sort of level that playing field, if you will.

Over 90 percent of the particulate matter and nitrous oxides have been eliminated from our exhaust pipes at a tremendous cost. A catalytic converter on a new truck costs me as an investor in that equipment $9,700. We cannot continue to add costs on an industry that is so vital to our economic engine. Let me my company as an example. We have a little over 400 trucks based on Shelbyville. We drive about 36 million miles a year and we use a little over 5 million gallons of fuel. A sudden impact on that when we operate on pennies puts us out of business. We cannot afford to do that. Speculation in the carbon markets will add to the volatility of this fuel and drive more companies out of business. The Nation's long-haul trucking industry depends on diesel fuel. We are not recreational users. We don't choose to go to the movie house in our trucks. We use the fuel to deliver products and services to the American public. We don't make useless trips.

Nuclear has been around for a generation. Elements of the smart grid have been around for a generation.
