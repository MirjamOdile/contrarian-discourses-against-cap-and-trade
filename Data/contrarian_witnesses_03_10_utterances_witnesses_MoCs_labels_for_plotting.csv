What we have tried to do within the Agency is to take advantage of everything that we have learned over the last 30 years. And the Clear Skies Act proposal is really historic, I believe in the history of environmental law in this country, because it is the first time that an administration has proposed to review carefully a piece of environmental legislation and to expand and modernize and take advantage of the parts that work very well and use those to replace the parts that haven't worked as well. And as a result, what I can guarantee you this morning is, if you adopt Clear Skies, we will get greater environmental benefits, certainly over the next decade, substantially--substantially cleaner air quality in this country. We will do it at the lowest possible cost. If we were to achieve these same benefits using the traditional mechanisms, it would be much more costly.

In all of those cities east of the Mississippi, the single largest part of that--and for those of you who are interested in even more detail, we can provide it to you. But we have a lot of studies showing that the biggest part of that problem is sulphate. And the sulphate emission, the sulphate part of the fine particles comes from SO2 emissions, and by far the lion's share of the SO2, comes from the burning of coal for electric power from power plants. Another big part is nitrate that comes from NOX emissions. So let me quickly point you to this chart that shows that nationally the power sector is responsible for about 63 percent of the SO2. It is actually even higher than that in the eastern part of the United States, responsible for about a fourth of the NOX emissions. And if you look at that NOX chart, you see that big green slice is the transportation sector. That part is shrinking over time as the fleet turns over with cleaner cars and cleaner trucks that are in place now. So the power sector, notwithstanding the progress that has been made, continues to be primarily responsible for this regional transport that causes the nonattainment problem in the entire eastern United States, at least in the major urban areas.","Holmstead, Hon.

Because it is a market-based program that allows the utility sector collectively to find the least costly way of achieving these reductions, it has turned out to be much less expensive than people envisioned back in 1990. I was peripherally involved in some of those discussions, and I remember discussions about how much the cost would be to impose that cap, about a 50 percent reduction in SO2 emissions. And back in 1990, EPA estimated the annual cost would be about $5.7 billion. The industry estimated $7 billion. Four years later, as people had an economic incentive to go out and find the best ways to reduce these emissions, the most effective ways, the estimates of full implementation went from--again the industry, in this case EPRE which is associated with EEI, that estimated went from $7 billion a year to $2.5 billion a year. GAO estimated $2.3 billion a year. And 8 years later, in 1998, the most recent study, EPRE, estimated its estimate or revised its estimate downward to $1.6 billion, a very well-recognized think tank, RFF, projects it is about $1 billion a year.","Holmstead, Hon.

They are borne by ratepayers. Even though the incremental rate increase is small, it is shared by ratepayer, the costs aren't passed through in the rates, they are borne by the shareholders of those companies who tend to live nationwide as well. And it is even more shared than that because to the extent that any of those costs go into goods and services, those are borne equally. So I can't tell you exactly what the distribution is, but I can tell you that the costs don't fall exclusively on coalminers. This is one of the issues that we have tried to look at. We actually believe there will be an increase in coal jobs in Appalachia as a result of Clear Skies for this simple reason. When the utility sector has the certainty of what-- right now, they don't know what they are going to have to do for mercury. They will--they don't know what to do for NOX, for the SO2. On top of that, there is visibility issues and other things. So they have very little regulatory certainty. There is a great deal of concern about investing hundreds of millions of dollars in control technology when they are not sure what the next issue that will come along is going to do. If we can provide that with our certainty all of our analysis and DOE's analysis suggest that at the levels and timing we are talking about, what they would do is install advance pollution controls on all that coal. So they can continue to burn the coal, they just burn it much more cleanly. I think we are all sympathetic to the concern have you raised, but we think this is the way to deal with them.","Holmstead, Hon.

Caps such as those proposed by policymakers in Washington are just the first step. As many of us know, the call is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 60 to 80 percent by 2050. So, a small first step is just the beginning of additional reductions, which increase uncertainty for investors. Furthermore, unlike EU firms, U.S. firms would be compelled to comply with emission reduction targets.

Caps would also increase electricity prices, reduce economic growth, and reduce the uncertainty about the return that could be expected on investment.

American Electric Power, Duke, Southern Company are all going forward with integrated gas combined-cycle technology facilities, all of which are extremely expensive and very much technologically driven. So, even with those credits in hand, we're going forward with that. So, part of the premise that is used by Michael, I think was a bit of a misstatement. I want to make sure that we get that on the record so that people realize how we use those. And to the extent that credits were in excess of the actual emissions targets that we have, and they were monetized, that goes back to your customer by way of a credit to the fuel cost. So, there is no gain. If, in fact, you went to an output--to someone who incurs no cost, then it would be a huge gain. And if those people were willing to credit whatever they got by selling those back to their customers as a credit to the fuel costs over the overall cost of delivery of electricity, that might be a fair way to look at that. But, short of that, it's just an economic grab.","Morris, Michael, Chairman of the Board of Directors, Edison Electric Institute",Edison Electric Institute,Electric Utilities,Energy & Natural Resources,Fossil Fuel Industry,Electric Utilities,0.0,Edison Electric Institute,Contrarian,Other contrarian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,225,7008,cc8171c7-a3df-4093-95e8-306aebed8453,Batch 1: Random sample,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

It is--third, it is facile to attribute the current resurgence of the disease to climate change or to use models based on temperature to predict future prevalence.

The disease was going to move to rich countries in the temperate regions as temperatures increased. This prediction ignored the fact that malaria was once an important cause of morbidity and mortality throughout most of the United States and Europe, even in the period that our climatology colleagues have called the Little Ice Age. In the United States, as in Western Europe, despite a steadily warming climate, prevalence of malaria declined in the 19th century as a result of multiple changes in agriculture, lifestyle that affected the abundance of mosquitoes, their contact with people, and the availability of antimalarial drugs. Nevertheless, the most catastrophic epidemic of all time on record anywhere in the world occurred in the Soviet Union in the 1920s, with a peak incidence of 13 million cases per year and 600,000 deaths. Transmission was high in many parts of Siberia, and there were 30,000 cases and 10,000 deaths in Archangel, close to the Arctic Circle. The disease persisted in many parts of Europe until the advent of DDT.

The two principal methods for temperature reconstructions have been used. CFR, climate field construction is used in MBH98/99 although that terminology was not used formally until 2005, I believe, and the other is CPS, climate-plus-scale methodology. The CFR is essentially the principal component-based analysis and the CPS is a simple averaging of climate proxies. The controversy of the MBH98/99 method lies in that the proxies are incorrectly centered on the mean period of 1902 to 1995, rather than on the whole time period. The proxy data exhibiting the hockey stick are actually decentered low. The updated MBH98/99 reconstruction is given in figure 3. This fact that the proxies are centered low is apparent in figure 3 because for most of the thousand years the reconstruction is below zero. This is temperature anomaly. Because the hockey stick proxies are centered too low, they will exhibit a large effective variance, allowing the method to exhibit a preference for selecting them as the first principal component. The net effect of decentering the proxy data in MBH98 and MBH99 is to produce the hockey stick shape. Centering on the overall mean is a critical factor in using principal component methodology properly.","Wegman, Dr. Edward J., Center for Computational Statistics, George Mason University",George Mason University,Education,Other,Scientists,Scientists,0.0,George Mason University,Contrarian,Denialist,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,203,7883,cc8171c7-a3df-4093-95e8-306aebed8453,Batch 2: Active learning sample (oversampling rare claims),0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

The centering does make a significant difference in the reconstruction, and as you see, while the top panel illustrates the temperature rise or purported temperature rise in the last 100 years or so, the bottom panel when properly centered does not have this temperature rise.","Wegman, Dr. Edward J., Center for Computational Statistics, George Mason University",George Mason University,Education,Other,Scientists,Scientists,0.0,George Mason University,Contrarian,Denialist,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,87,7884,cc8171c7-a3df-4093-95e8-306aebed8453,Batch 2: Active learning sample (oversampling rare claims),0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

First of all, when I read the paper originally, it took me probably 10 times to read it to really understand what he was trying to say. He uses phrases that are not standard in the literature I am familiar with. He uses, for example, the phrase ""statistical skill"" and I floated that phrase by a lot of my statistical colleagues and nobody had ever heard of that phrase, statistical skill. He uses measures of quality of fit that are not focused on the kind of things typically we do. We went to his website to try and figure out where his data was. He has a website at the University of Virginia. We basically downloaded everything that was in his FTP website to try and gather together--try and understand what was going on. The materials tended to be very cryptic. When we looked at the Fortran code that he wrote, it was very difficult to understand how you could, in the Fortran code you read in the data, but it was unclear where the data was and how you could actually read it in and the coding of the data, so all those things tended to make it very difficult to try and replicate anything that he did. Ultimately, I believe it was in 2004, he published a corrigendum and it showed that some of the data that he used in the 1998 paper was not referenced in the 1998 paper and other material that he did reference in the 1998 paper was not actually used. So there was a lack of clarity in both the archived data as well as the writing of the appear itself that I found difficult to decipher.","Wegman, Dr. Edward J., Center for Computational Statistics, George Mason University",George Mason University,Education,Other,Scientists,Scientists,0.0,George Mason University,Contrarian,Denialist,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,291,8130,cc8171c7-a3df-4093-95e8-306aebed8453,Batch 2: Active learning sample (oversampling rare claims),0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

It is no surprise to any working scientist that there are groups of statisticians, groups of mathematicians, groups of paleoclimate scientists, groups of physicists that work together closely and that there are competing social networks. I would hasten to add that social networks doesn't mean I go out and drink a beer with somebody. It doesn't mean I am a buddy of theirs. It means that I work with them, that I think like they do, that we have similar approaches. Now, if the group of people operating in this area is relatively small, as I believe it is in the paleoclimate area, then I think there is some evidence that probably should be investigated more clearly, that these people are refereeing their own papers. After all, Michael Mann was an editor of the Journal of Climate and he publishes a lot of his papers in the Journal of Climate.

First, little reliance can be placed not only the original Mann reconstruction, various efforts to salvage it, or similar multi-proxy studies even ones which did not use Mann's methodology. Second, peer review as practiced by academic journals is not an audit but something much more limited. In turn, scientific overviews such as the ones produced by IPCC or even by the NAS panel are based almost entirely on literature review rather than independent testing. Third, there is already an existing data archive which is excellent, but in order to make it work scientists actually have to archive their data and code. This is not done consistently in the paleoclimate community and it makes replication virtually impossible in many cases. Much of this work is funded by the U.S. Federal government and some very simple administrative measures under existing policies could alleviate many of the problems.","McIntyre, Stephen, Toronto, Ontario, Canada",No affiliation,Individuals,Other,Other,Individuals,0.0,,Contrarian,Denialist,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,150,8755,cc8171c7-a3df-4093-95e8-306aebed8453,Batch 2: Active learning sample (oversampling rare claims),0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

This is simply not the case as you see by the graph on both screens. The NAS panel illustrated several other reconstructions but their consideration was merely a literature review. They did not attempt to replicate or audit these other studies as I have tried to do. Each one has replication problems. One of the criticisms of the Mann study recognized by the NAS panel was its use of bristle cones and closely related foxtails, a flawed proxy which the panel said should be avoided. However, they did not assess this. The impact of not using bristle cones can be substantial. Removal of merely two bristle cone series changes relative medieval modern levels in the Crowley and Lowery reconstruction that was shown to you earlier. The panel noted the so-called divergence problem in which temperatures in the last half of the 20th Century increase while tree ring widths and densities decrease. They offered no solution other than reduced confidence, but the problem is worse. How can we even trust the shape of the curve in previous warm periods if they miss the present one? Bias sampling can arise not simply from Mann's principal component methods, but by non-random and biased selection of small samples. In this graph shown here, even the selection of a single site, of a different version from a single site can have a dramatic impact on a worldwide reconstruction. Here different versions impact the Briffa 2000 reconstruction and all but one subsequent reconstruction shown in the various spaghetti graphs. The issue of the polar Urals is substantive. Naurzbaev et al., which included Mann's coauthor Hughes, whose methods were cited by the NAS panel with a approval, concluded that medieval summer temperatures in this area were over 2.3 degrees Centigrade warmer than at present.","McIntyre, Stephen, Toronto, Ontario, Canada",No affiliation,Individuals,Other,Other,Individuals,0.0,,Contrarian,Denialist,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,327,8757,cc8171c7-a3df-4093-95e8-306aebed8453,Batch 2: Active learning sample (oversampling rare claims),0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

A simple policy shown here already in existence at the American Economic Review and other journals and in fact a policy introduced by Dr. Bernanke, presently Chairman of the Federal Reserve System, would alleviate many of these problems. There is no reason for journals not to adopt similar rules for paleoclimatology where data sets are similar in size and scale to many econometric studies. In fact, the 1991 policy statement of the U.S. global change research program already requires data archiving and many agencies such as NASA have complied with these policies. However, the National Science Foundation does not and a senior NSF official wrote to me saying that dissemination of data was merely up to the professional judgment of the researchers. Ironically, even the NAS panel relied heavily on unarchived data. The Department of Energy itself does not comply.

Sir John Houghton, co-chair of IPCC, testified to a Senate committee that our claims were false. So while I would say not all of our claims have been acknowledged, some of them have.

The study was being--we were told in Canada that 1998 was the warmest year of the millennium. I have worked in the mineral exploration business for many years. I deal with geologists who were unimpressed by that statement and I just wondered one day how they knew that. When I looked at the IPCC report as somebody that is in the mineral exploration business, which is a very promotional business, I was struck at how promotional many of the statements were and particular how promotional the hockey stick graph was. I thought actually sort of in a professional way, I thought it was well designed, well presented. It was there to convey a message but I certainly felt like I was being sold when I saw that. Some months later, business was slow. I thought I would be interested in looking at the data. I assumed there was some kind of due diligence package like you would see in a business thing that they had prepared for the IPCC auditors. At that time I had no idea that such things didn't typically exist in the academic community so I e-mailed Dr. Mann out of the blue and asked him where the data was and just for the location of the data of this which I assumed to be part of the due diligence package and he said he had forgotten where the data was. So I was astonished as there had been so much publicity. He said he would have an associate locate it for me.

These borehole temperatures from Greenland represented probably the most reliable regional temperatures over the last millennium. Thus, in at least one location we had high confidence that it was warmer 1,000 years ago, and though Greenland's temperature may not be tightly connected to hemispheric averages, Greenland is important for sea level averages. If Greenland were warmer in the relatively recent past were its edges also melting as they appear to be now under cooler conditions? I believe the IPCC missed an opportunity to demonstrate climate complexity by excluding this information in 2001. Dr. Roy Spencer and I created the first satellite-based data set temperature back in 1990.

The real problem, and the one observed by Wegman, is that the PC method as applied to low quality data caused a minor pattern, in this case bristlecones, to be exaggerated as a dominant pattern in worldwide climate.","McIntyre, Stephen, Toronto, Ontario, Canada",No affiliation,Individuals,Other,Other,Individuals,0.0,,Contrarian,Denialist,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,109,9055,cc8171c7-a3df-4093-95e8-306aebed8453,Batch 2: Active learning sample (oversampling rare claims),0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

So the question is are these valid temperature proxies. I quote from our report, ""Graybill and Idso, 1993, specifically sought to show that bristlecone pines were CO2 fertilized. Bondi et al., 1999, suggest bristlecones are not reliable temperature proxy for the last 150 years as it shows an increasing trend in about 1850 that has been attributed to atmospheric CO2 fertilization."" We also know that IPCC 1996 report stated that the possible confounding effects of carbon dioxide fertilization need to be taken into account when calibrating tree ring data against climate variations.

In my testimony I refer to some research that was done looking at some of the State and local initiatives related to climate change mitigation. The question was: what makes these successful? When do they work? When do they go beyond the statement of aspirations into actual progress on the ground? What those researchers found was that when those local government entities were able to line up--and this holds true for companies, as well--their short-term motivations, whether it is reducing the cost of energy, improving transportation efficiencies, reducing air pollution, it is much easier for them to sell and put into place these policies that may be justified as long-term climate change policies.","Roger A.

I want to emphasize that nothing in this testimony or in any of my work on climate change over the past decade or more should be interpreted as being opposed to or somehow contrary to the mitigation of greenhouse gases.

China is not something to fear, the rapid development in China is an opportunity. China is using enormous amounts of expensive energy. If the United States through an innovation agenda, investing in the development of cleaner, cheaper, energy technologies gets there first, then the Chinese are going to rush to buy our products. So it seems to me that if we think about not just climate change but about innovation, competitiveness, as a much bigger picture, the development in China is nothing to be afraid of or that it should limit our action. It is really an opportunity, particularly for the science community, to invest money in innovation that puts us out in front so that our economy grows, and we capture some of that $80 trillion in growth.","Dr. Roger A.

African women collect firewood each day and carry it home for heating and cooking. This inefficient and toxic source of energy kills about 1.6 million women and children a year. When an African woman carrying 50 pounds of firewood risks her life by jumping out in front of my van in an attempt to stop me to give her a lift, I see the value of energy. You see, what I had in my school van in terms of the amount of gasoline I could held in my cupped hands could move her and her firewood 2 or 3 miles down the road to her home. I understood the astounding benefit energy represents and to what extent she and her people would go to acquire it. Energy demand will grow because it makes life less brutal and less short.","John R.

Now we might be surprised in 20 years and know something else.

Let's further stipulate that the warming produced no benefits, only harms. That is still an amazing bargain, Goldberg remarks. Average life expectancies doubled in the 20th century. The human population nearly quadrupled. Yet per capita food supplies increased.

That is when Britain, for economic reasons, switched from taxpayer-subsidized coal to free market natural gas, which made a lot of sense when natural gas was less expensive than coal.

Unless the legislation you are considering takes the regulatory action out of EPA's hands with respect to carbon dioxide, you can't even have a pretext of cost certainty or regulatory certainty, because as soon as EPA gets around to making a judgment that carbon dioxide emissions endanger public health and welfare, it will have to start a NAAQS (National Ambient Air Quality Standards) rulemaking. The Supreme Court has forbidden EPA to take costs and technical feasibility into account when setting national ambient air quality standards. Some folks at this table think the current CO2 levels endanger public health and welfare, the only way we can lower CO2 levels below current levels would be by de-industrializing the world.","Lewis, Marlo, Senior Fellow, Competitive Enterprise Institute",Competitive Enterprise Institute,Republican/Conservative,Ideological/Single-Issue,Non-Profit Organisations,Partisan Non-Profits,0.0,Competitive Enterprise Institute,Contrarian,Denialist,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,140,24171,cc8171c7-a3df-4093-95e8-306aebed8453,Batch 1: Random sample,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

The term ``rational'' means ``rationing,'' the market is the chief instrument for rationing scarce resources, which is the fundamental problem of an economy.

It prevents gaming of the system, as we have seen widespread instances of in Europe, and windfall profits being accrued by companies that were allocated the credits.","Thorning, Margo, Ph.D., senior vice president and chief economist, American Council for Capital Formation",American Council for Capital Formation,Business Associations,Misc Business,Business & Services,Misc Business,0.0,American Council for Capital Formation,Contrarian,Other contrarian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,90,27484,cc8171c7-a3df-4093-95e8-306aebed8453,Batch 3: Active learning sample (claim 4),0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Let us consider the following facts. America's international trade in goods and services accounts for roughly 27 percent of our country's GDP. Nationwide our exports directly support 12 million good-paying jobs and indirectly support millions of other jobs. More than 57 million Americans are employed by businesses that engage in international trade, and the benefits reach every state in our Nation. The combined effects of trade agreements over the past half-century have raised the annual income of an American household by $10,000. In 2007, the United States exported a record $1.6 trillion in goods and services and continues to be the world's largest exporter. These facts cannot be overlooked. Further, one should not also overlook the fact that the climate change discussion involves trading relationships that the United States has with countries around the world.","Christopher Wenk, Senior Director, International Policy, U.S. Chamber of Commerce",U.S. Chamber of Commerce,Business Associations,Misc Business,Business & Services,Misc Business,0.0,US Chamber of Commerce,Contrarian,Other contrarian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,160,29958,cc8171c7-a3df-4093-95e8-306aebed8453,Batch 3: Active learning sample (claim 4),1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

However, several developing countries besides China and India could possibly be considered significant emitters. These countries include Nigeria, Ecuador, Indonesia, Malaysia, and South Africa to name a few. These countries also export to the United States raw and intermediate products like oil and minerals that require them to purchase import allowances. One could argue that the imposition of the import allowance requirement on these countries would have a negative impact on their economic development. There is also the question of whether climate change legislation would make the United States vulnerable to a challenge under the WTO or NAFTA, for that matter. As noted on page 13 of the white paper, there is a general expectation that a WTO challenge is likely regardless of what approach Congress takes. However, I think it is safe to assume that we could screw up trading relationships around the world before we even got to a possible WTO dispute settlement proceeding. In this time of economic uncertainty, the Chamber urges Congress to not risk provoking a trade war with countries like China or India where the United States exported almost $83 billion worth of goods combined in 2007. Most recently, Brazil scored a big victory at the WTO over America's cotton subsidies. Brazil has reserved the right to impose annual sanctions of up to $4 billion on the United States. If the United States fails to comply with this ruling, Brazil has said that it would target American goods as well as trademarks, patents, and commercial services for retaliation.","Christopher Wenk, Senior Director, International Policy, U.S. Chamber of Commerce",U.S. Chamber of Commerce,Business Associations,Misc Business,Business & Services,Misc Business,0.0,US Chamber of Commerce,Contrarian,Other contrarian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,283,29960,cc8171c7-a3df-4093-95e8-306aebed8453,Batch 3: Active learning sample (claim 4),0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Last fall the United States and the European Union submitted a proposal as part of the ongoing Doha round of WTO negotiations to increase global trade in and the use of environmental goods and services. It would place priority action on technologies directly linked to addressing climate change and energy security.

And you know, in 2007, they exported $113 billion of raw materials to the United States. And I think a real fundamental question of any cap-and-trade program is how this would impact possibly our NAFTA obligations, and I think that these are things that need to be looked into a little bit more. But I think we cannot overlook the fact that, sure, there are WTO obligations that we need to be certain cognizant of, but there are also NAFTA obligations. And if there were some sort of cap-and-trade program, there may be give a special pass to Canada because they signed onto Kyoto and they maybe met some of their commitments.

Again, I think it is very easy to pick out a target and timetable. It is a whole other question if you want to ask how we are going to do this, and I think the how we are going to do this question really needs to be considered before you pick out the target and timetable, and I think in many cases, that is not being done. If you extrapolate that chart out to 2050, again, I think what we would be saying is if you had the full suite of technologies in play at that point in time, including nuclear, which is a zero carbon, carbon capture and storage on coal plants, at least on new coal plants, and have been putting them on from the 2030 time frame on, and that you have renewables and that you have energy efficiency and you have plug-in hybrid vehicles, you would essentially be in a much lower carbon fuel supply situation.

Number one, if you do borrow, you are going to be borrowing from future allowances, which most likely are going to be much more expensive in the future and I think that is going to cause problems, at least in the beginning years when you are putting in place the largest trading system that has ever been established in the world, a multitrillion-dollar trading system. We all know the challenges we have had with a lot of trading systems. You can go back to the Enron situation or mortgage-backed securities or whatever. There has been a lot of volatility in a lot of trading systems. There has been a lot of manipulation.

According to a Natural Gas Council study, climate legislation is likely to increase the demand for natural gas. A sound climate policy should enable more supply of natural gas, not less. However, a study by ICF International commissioned by API and included with my testimony estimates the Lieberman- Warner bill would have reduced natural gas supplies by 12 percent. The estimated fall in natural gas supplies is because of the added costs of production and gas processing. A Wood Mackenzie study estimates even greater supply reductions. Our ICF study also estimates that the legislation would shift refinery capacity overseas by 3 million barrels a day, or 17 percent of U.S. capacity. The estimated shift in refinery capacity would have also meant lost jobs and the export of emissions overseas.","John Felmy, Chief Economist, American Petroleum Institute",American Petroleum Institute,Oil & Gas,Energy & Natural Resources,Fossil Fuel Industry,Fossil Fuel Extraction,0.0,American Petroleum Institute,Contrarian,Other contrarian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,139,32504,cc8171c7-a3df-4093-95e8-306aebed8453,Batch 3: Active learning sample (claim 4),0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

It fails to safeguard against potentially triggering overlapping federal regulations for greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act, NEPA and the Endangered Species Act.

The Stern Review was not the first time that the economic consequences of global warming were studied. One recent tally points out that it is number 211 in a long series. There have been hundreds of studies looking at the economic consequences if climate-model projections are true. The median costs that emerge from these studies on a per-tonne basis fall in the range of about $0 to $20, and because there are relatively few abatement policies available in that range, cost-benefit analysis does not support deep emission cuts. The Stern Review, as has been noted, used some methodology and assumptions to generate much higher estimates of the per-tonne costs and fairly low estimates of the abatement costs. Those assumptions have been subject to quite a bit of criticism in the economics literature, not simply the discounting assumption, but other methodologies as well, and I think the Stern Review has been convincingly shown to be an unreliable guide for decision- making.","Ross McKitrick, Associate Professor and Director of Graduate Studies, Department of Economics, University of Guelph",University of Guelph,Education,Other,Scientists,Scientists,0.0,,Contrarian,Denialist,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,191,33563,cc8171c7-a3df-4093-95e8-306aebed8453,Batch 2: Active learning sample (oversampling rare claims),0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

There have been a lot of studies comparing carbon taxes to cap-and-trade instruments. Cap-and-trade, for the same outcome, costs many times more than what a carbon tax would. Cap-and-trade, you should understand, is basically a cartel- forming device. It allows a group of energy producers in this case to restrict output, raise consumer prices, and pocket windfall gains as a result. One study showed that the distortions in the economy from cap-and-trade would be so severe that the very first tonne of emission reduction would begin at a cost between $20 and $55 a ton. So if you do choose cap-and-trade, you have to believe that the marginal damages of CO2 emissions are at least as high as that; otherwise, you are guaranteed to make people worse off by implementing it.","Ross McKitrick, Associate Professor and Director of Graduate Studies, Department of Economics, University of Guelph",University of Guelph,Education,Other,Scientists,Scientists,0.0,,Contrarian,Denialist,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,152,33564,cc8171c7-a3df-4093-95e8-306aebed8453,Batch 3: Active learning sample (claim 4),0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Now, in the future, the carbon tax might be expected to go up, but there is no agreement at what rate it should go up. I would suggest, and I have argued in a number of publications, that future increases in any carbon tax should be tied to the actual, observed mean temperature in the atmosphere. That way, if the people who are concerned about the greenhouse gasses are right, the carbon tax would go up rapidly in the years ahead, and you would get steady emissions reductions as a result. On the other hand, if greenhouse gasses are not really causing much global warming, then the tax won't rise, nor should it--either way, the severity of the problem guides the policy response, and I think it is a common principle in any policy undertaking that you tie the stringency of the policy to the severity of the problem, and I would remind you that that principle should apply in this case as well.

But they have totally ignored the 800 pound gorilla in the room: natural internal chaotic fluctuations in the climate system.","Spencer, Roy W., Principal Research Scientist, Earth System Science Center, University of Alabama, Huntsville",University of Alabama,Education,Other,Scientists,Scientists,0.0,,Contrarian,Denialist,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,65,33770,,Batch 2: Active learning sample (oversampling rare claims),0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

CO2 is not a pollutant. It is not a poison and we should not corrupt the English language by depriving pollutant and poison of their original meaning. When we exhale, each of us here, our exhaled breath is 4 percent CO2. That is about 40,000 parts per million, 100 times the current atmospheric concentrations. CO2 is absolutely essential for life. Commercial greenhouse operators often use CO2 as a fertilizer to improve the health and growth rate of their plants. Plants and our own primate ancestors evolved when the levels of atmospheric CO2 were about 1,000 parts per million, a level we will probably not reach by burning fossil fuels. By the way, the oceans did just fine then, at 1,000 parts per million.

Countries such as China and India already rely upon coal to meet over 70 percent of their electricity needs. They, like us, depend on coal to sustain their economies and to raise their standard of living. The second point is as follows. Neither this Nation nor the global community can address climate effectively without advance clean coal technologies including, and most importantly, carbon capture and storage. Between 2007 and 2030 global energy demand is projected to increase by 50 percent. CO2 emissions are projected to increase by 57 percent according to the International Energy Agency. Virtually all of this emissions growth will come from non-OECD nations, and the point being is if the United States and every OECD nation completely stopped using coal 75 percent of all CO2 emissions would remain untouched and unaddressed.","Harold P.

The solution we all seek requires that we harmonize the timing when controls are placed on emissions with the commercial availability of the critical CCS technologies needed to reduce them. The consequences of getting this policy wrong could be dire. The period of time between when promising technologies are developed and successful commercialization is often referred to as potential valley of death. By extension industries may confront a valley of death but they are trapped in the period between the mandate requiring a certain level of performance and availability of the technology enabling them to meet the requirement. The same fate could befall our economy if we impose harsh restrictions that jeopardize our ability to meet electricity demand before we have the necessary tools to meet future emissions requirements.,"Harold P.

First, policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions such as were debated last year in Congress with the Lieberman-Warner proposal or the new Obama Administration proposal are virtually certain to reduce jobs and to increase unemployment. May I draw your attention to Table 1 of my testimony which presents a survey of different modeling results on the Lieberman-Warner bill from the ACCF-NAM study, Charles River, the Energy Information Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency, and MIT. There is a range of estimates for the impact of the loss of jobs and GDP which, in 2020, which, the lowest is .7 percent of GDP, the highest from EPA is 1.5 percent loss in GDP. Job losses in 2020 range from 270,000 fewer jobs to as many as 3.2 million fewer jobs. And these modeling results do take account of new, green jobs that are thought about as we move more into renewables and alternative technologies. By 2030, the results are even more striking. So I think the evidence suggests that cap-and-trade proposals such as are being discussed now will certainly have a negative impact on U.S. employment and job growth and will speed leakage of jobs abroad.","Margo Thorning, Ph.D., Senior Vice President and Chief Economist, American Council for Capital Formation",American Council for Capital Formation,Business Associations,Misc Business,Business & Services,Misc Business,0.0,American Council for Capital Formation,Contrarian,Other contrarian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,201,43084,,Batch 1: Random sample,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Those show revenue cost to taxpayers and business of three to four times higher. So I am guessing that actually the Obama plan would bring in a trillion to over $3 trillion over the 2012-2019 period. So that is a very significant cost that would have the impact, of course, of slowing job growth and GDP growth, and in fact the Administration recognizes that. If you look at their budget, page 129 of their budget, footnote five, it says that if additional revenues are raised, those will be rebated to the public.

There are things we can do here. I commend you to look at Table 2 of my testimony which shows how slow the capital cost recovery is in the United States for new energy investments. Our Ernst and Young study which is on our ACCF Web site shows that the United States has the worst capital cost recovery and the highest effective tax rate on new energy investment of major industrial countries. We could also continue to promote international cooperation that previously administrations have started through the Asia-Pacific Partnership, the Global Nuclear Energy Partnership, Clean Technology, and the Major Economies Initiative. These international agreements are designed to promote technology transfer.","Margo Thorning, Ph.D., Senior Vice President and Chief Economist, American Council for Capital Formation",American Council for Capital Formation,Business Associations,Misc Business,Business & Services,Misc Business,0.0,American Council for Capital Formation,Contrarian,Other contrarian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,127,43089,cc8171c7-a3df-4093-95e8-306aebed8453,Batch 1: Random sample,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Carbon capture sequestration and nuclear will not be contributors over the next 10 years, which means the power sector will be dependent upon natural gas for power generation. Expansion of renewable energy means electric utility companies will be required to build natural gas-fired backup plants.

One is, would a green jobs policy, or narrow RPS mandates, I say narrow because, for example, the U.S. Conference of Mayors report on green jobs includes jobs in the nuclear industry as green jobs, yet the nuclear industry is conspicuously excluded from non- carbon sources contemplated in the draft discussion.

A rather rudimentary description of the petroleum refining process but one that must be achieved in order to facilitate technological and commercial success is a rearrangement of the links between and among hydrocarbon molecules. It has been a very long time since refineries were described as structures that boil oil or simply are a bubble in the oil pipeline. Today's refineries are complex, sophisticated, state-of-the-art facilities that operate most efficiently while providing consumers with the reliable products that drive the Nation's economy from clean burning gasoline, diesel and home heating oil to the petrochemical feedstocks that are building blocks for a multitude of products, asphalt to aspirin, cosmetics to computers, heart valves to helmets, pharmaceuticals to patio furniture. The domestic refining industry is the linchpin for these products. Transforming various hydrocarbon molecules, again, rearranging the molecular links of the oil in a technologically advanced, environmentally sound and economically viable fashion is vital to the success of the domestic refining industry and the overall economy it drives.","Charles T.

The first is, as you consider how you are going to do this, probably the one part that troubles us the most is, you have very steep emission reductions over the course of the years but there is really no assurance in the bill that as you force fossil fuels out of the system, that there is a mechanism for bringing substitute technologies into the system, and I say that because, and I am just going to use one example. If you just take the 115,000-megawatt windows that you are going to need, that is going to take enough space that is literally going to equal going around the earth twice, and it is an enormous land mass, and the problem you are going to run into is not that price isn't going to drive technologies but many times NIMBYs are going to drive technologies out, and one of the things we have done with this project is we have tried to identify the fact that in the last 18 months there have been 65 renewable facilities that have not been able to get to the marketplace because of NIMBYs and 13 grid systems.

Probably the biggest issue that we care about is that we don't think you can get enough energy back in the system as a substitute for what you are going to take out. I will give you an example, clean coal, the Bard facility in Ohio. Here was an example where they went through the DOE loan guarantee process. They literally got all of their permits. They were about to break ground and then they were notified by several environmental groups that they were going to sue. DOE then decided that the risk of that lawsuit was so great, they were going to pull the loan guarantees. This is clean coal, and so what happened is, the company walked away from the project, and if that was the only project, we probably wouldn't care but we have right now looked, and we have only been doing this a month, we have got about 300. I mean, there are other, it is not just energy. The other day we had a presentation on cell towers and someone said well, there are 800 on hold because of this. This is a big issue and we have to deal with it, and we got a lot of cooperation in the stimulus plan when we started off, how do we move this through. We wanted a time limit, and Senator Boxer and Senator Barrasso finally came to an agreement that we would use the most expedited route. But this is an issue that I think if you can solve and start making us feel like we are going to have real energy in this country and it is not going to get stopped, you are going to then find that some of our major concerns are really starting to be addressed.","William L.

The allocation proposal ensures that all classes of electricity customers receive the benefits of the value of the emissions allowances regardless of the size, location or ownership structure of the LDC. Targeting LDCs as the primary recipient of the allowances ensures that the benefits and costs of those allowances flow directly to end-use consumers. LDC rates are regulated by State commissions. These commissions have extensive oversight experience and authority to ensure that allowances received by LDCs will be reflected in any rate- making cases. The bill enhances the role of State commissions and includes safeguards to ensure that allowances directly benefit customers. Allocations to LDCs can also take into account regional variations in electricity use generation mix and cost. Different regions use different amounts of fossil fuel to produce electricity. Some regions use more coal than others. Average customer demand for electricity also varies significantly by region due to such things as weather and the price of power.","Thomas F.

Most of the models predict there will be less radiation escaping into space if you warm the surface. The truth, however, as you see in the middle panel now, that is the earth radiation budget experiment satellite measurement, it shows a very rapid increase in the amount of outgoing radiation escaping to space as you warm the surface. What that means very simply is that the radiation isn't being trapped down here to cause warming at anything like the rate that the U.N. predicts, and that is why Professor Lindzen of MIT has concluded that the amount of warming you can expect to get from a doubling of CO2 concentration--this is scientific measurement, not playing with Xbox 360 models--is only naught.7 Kelvin, compared with a 3.26 plus or minus naught.69, which is the best estimate of the U.N.'s climate panel.

But what is commonly forgotten--and that is crucial to this hearing--is that these facts do not lead to major climate concern per se.

One that we overestimated--underestimated sea surface temperatures from 1944 to 1965. That was published by Thompson in Nature Magazine. Number two, that there are nonclimatic subtle effects on the temperature history. That was published by McKitrick in the Journal of Geophysics Atmospheres. Susan Solomon found that water vapor in the stratosphere is responsible for a lot of the secular changes. And we don't know why water vapors fluctuate in the stratosphere. It is not a greenhouse effect. I mean, it is not--it is not, apparently, from greenhouse gas emissions.

Now, he has identified four things--economic activity, black carbon, errors in the sea surface temperature data and stratospheric water vapor--and he said, I think all of those things have had a warming influence, so I am going to subtract them from this .7 degrees and I am left with .3.

So that means the temperature of at least eastern Greenland had to be quite a bit warmer for a very long time, and the integrated warming is probably greater than what we could produce if we tried to burn as much carbon fuel as we could.

I mean, they view them as arrogant and whatever, and they were worried about U.N. policies taking over everything, and they were sort of scared. And then when Climategate struck with the e-mails, you know, then people really had more of a concrete reason that they felt not to trust scientists.","Dr. Judith A.

But it is an issue of the public trust, and a lot of the things like the IPCC assessment report is a heavy dose of expert judgment in those conclusions. And if you don't trust the experts, you know, what are we to make of their judgment? So the data and the fundamental research is there. It is how it is assessed, communicated, and by whom it becomes an issue.","Dr. Judith A.
