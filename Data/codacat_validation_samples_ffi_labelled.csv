We would find out that they do not have a comparable program, and a ton of steel would have a carbon allocation cost to it; and if that were $10 a ton, the importer would pay it. So if Ford Motors is buying steel from them, Ford would pay $10 and put them on exactly the same footing as Nucor selling steel to Ford.",0,0,0

And we were the beneficiary of a grant from the Department of Energy to build a coal gasification facility, one of only two that were built in the United States in the early 1990s. And we built it in Indiana, Wabash River Plant. And we used the Dow technology there. And we took the gas that came out of that unit and generated electricity. Here we are today, more than a decade later, working on a coal gas plant that is going to be closer to being what I call a commercial project versus demonstration. I think it is going to be very critical to have additional funding for carbon sequestration projects and carbon capture projects in these coal gas, because the economics of coal gas is very close to pulverized coal, depending on your assumptions about how carbon constrained we are in the future. The thing that really needs to be funded on these coal gas projects is really the funding of the carbon sequestration. And I think that would be very important in order to allow further development of the--because as you know, in technology, it is not the first generation, often not the second, but it is generally the third, fourth, and fifth technology, or generations in these technologies where it becomes very cost- effective.
